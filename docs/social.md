# Like a Social Network

1. Challenge: Not to create conditions that lead to mental health issues
   - The number of likes, views, followers — all of this causes problems for people.
2. Challenge: Not to become a mouthpiece of propaganda
3. Challenge: Not to suffer from spam
4. Challenge: To be useful
   - The same topics are raised again and again. Maybe it would be better to immediately show similar questions (tweets, messages, images) so that people don’t keep repeating the same old arguments, but instead look for new perspectives?
   - In other words, the task is to generate a finite graph, and when a person posts, to find a place in this graph — instead of creating an endless feed.
   - There would be no possibility to simply “post,” only the option to post deeper within the graph.
   - Only those who have somehow earned enough local “karma,” or moderators could post at the top or move messages up and down within the graph.
   - This essentially becomes a version of Wikipedia?
