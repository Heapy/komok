# Source Score

Calculate source score based on starred/read content. Use this score to rank entities for review. So low-score sources Komok might not show feed items immediately, but batch them and digest for review. This way instead of reviewing hundred if items from some low-score source, Komok will filter out interesting one and combine in a single item.
