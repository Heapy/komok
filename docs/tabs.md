# Tabs hoarding

## Why do people use tabs?

1. Switching between tasks, each tab is a task
2. Information buffering: to-do list in browser
3. Keeping state of the page, i.e I read to this point of the page

## Remove the need for too many tabs

1. Organize the tabs by the task in Komok
   - Add tabs to projects
   - Cache data from tabs
   - Provide TL;DR; for tabs, including videos
